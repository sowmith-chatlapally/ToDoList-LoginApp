## React Login/Logout Workflow
This is a simple login/logout system built with React, Redux and Node.js

### Installation

Install node nodules with:

```bash
npm install
```

Then start development environment (frontend and backend) with:

```bash
npm run devstart
```

Users are hardcoded in the backend. Working logins are:

```bash
const usersDatabase = [
  { email: "admin@email.it", password: "admin" },
  { email: "user1@email.it", password: "user1" },
  { email: "user2@email.it", password: "user2" },
  { email: "user3@email.it", password: "user3" },
  { email: "user4@email.it", password: "user4" }
];
```
